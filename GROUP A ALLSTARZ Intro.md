## GROUP A ALLSTARZ
Intro:
The Starz of this outfit were Viseth Auk (Project Manager), Toby Martin, Simon Zhang and my self Luke Macumber.
Now don’t expect to be a millionaire by the end of this presentation, but do keep in mind the possibilities of using these models are endless.
This was a very exciting Project for us all as we set out to explore an algorithm that we could all use and improve on after this bootcamp is complete, the main question we wanted answered was:
“Can we utilise Machine Learning to accurately predict entry and exit signals whilst trading, in order to make a consistent profit on Bitcoin?”

In this Project we set out to “compare and contrast” 3 different trading strategies: These were:
The very simple Buy & HODL (AKA: “Hold On For Dear Life”) model.
The not as simple, but simple enough Moving Average crossover model.  Buy/Sell on cross of MA’s.

And The One and Only LSTM (Long, Short Term Memory) model.
This was our main focus.
In many research publications there has been a lot of discussions around a new trading phenomenon used in various trading strategies known as the LSTM Model, often referred to as the Long-Term Short-Term Memory Model which is used in the neural network or machine learning arena. We wanted to uncover the truth behind this style of trading, is it truth or is it fiction?

In our project, we will explore and demonstrate how one type of RNN model, the LSTM network, can be used to predict price movement in financial time series data which is considered to be perhaps the most chaotic and difficult of all time series. We will seek to use the LSTM model to try and predict price movements and profit from it in our strategy.

It is an interesting thing to sit and ponder on which of these models might work best and we certainly all had our own expectations.  The final results of our findings might have you perplexed, intrigued and maybe a little surprised…
Now before I go on I must say, it has been a real pleasure to work with this group, and at no disrespect to my first project group, these were some of the smartest people I have had the pleasure of working with…
OK
After a couple of false starts, long discussions and much deliberation this is what we found…  Over to you Simon…
